Input: Query and All related documents
process: 
1. Tokenize all documents and query into a vectors. 
input: all the query and documents <!--excerpt-->
output: the vectors corresponding to query and documents.

2. Evaluate how extend every document satisfies query by BM25.
input: all vectors from 1 step.
output: the p(R=1| d,q) of every document. 

3. Rank every document by qPRP and PT.
input: the p(R=1| d,q)
output: the rank level of every document.

4. evaluate the order 
input: the rank from step 3 and how much a document satisfies the query in reality.
output: the precise rate.

output: the order and the evaluate based how much a document satisfies the query in reality.
