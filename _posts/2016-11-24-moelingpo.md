Considering nowadays propagation of Public Opinion  possessing different regular pattern and effect, it is the
respond of reality demand to research on network  ropagation mechanism of public opinion. Simulation is conducted based on network structured by improved scale-free network. Instead of study propagation by single method, the paper analyzes the view exchange process in detail by introducing different degree of individual’s stubbornness and belief degree. Deffaunt Model is used and improved. By studying two kinds of initialization, the paper ﬁnds out people will have distinct opinion after
propagation in the context of non-intervention, learning the nature of network’s inﬂuence in propagation.  Furthermore, when intervention is taken into  <!--excerpt--> consideration, the result shows the ﬁnite inﬂuence of changing individuals’ opinion by important nodes,
suggesting the steadiness of propagation in a certain network. Corresponding suggestions are given towards propagation of public opinion guidance as well.
