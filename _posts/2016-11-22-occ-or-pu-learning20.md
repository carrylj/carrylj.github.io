OCC or PU Learning Definition:
One Class Classification or Positive and Unlabeled Learning corresponds to a special case in machine learning when only a small proportion of positive samples and unlabeled ones are employed for learning task. One frequent task is generally to retrieve positive ones from the unlabeled in the training dataset, namely transductive learning. Detecting positive or identifying negative ones from the unlabeled in both training dataset and unknown is another popular task, also referred to as inductive learning.<!--excerpt--> 
Positive and unlabeled datasets are provided but the use of the unlabeled is up to the algorithm.
